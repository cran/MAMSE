Description: Calculates the nonparametric adaptive MAMSE
        weights for univariate, right-censored or multivariate data.
        The MAMSE weights can be used in a weighted likelihood or to
        define a mixture of empirical distribution functions. The package
        includes functions for the MAMSE weighted Kaplan-Meier estimate
        and for MAMSE weighted ROC curves.
