
Version 0.1-0 (2008-02-01):

 - Initial release.
 
Version 0.1-1 (2008-02-09):

 - Fixed 64-bit specific bug in the C code (use of long int).
 - Edited examples in the documentation to avoid overfull lines in the pdf
   version of the help files.
 - Removed unwanted comma in the Author and Maintainer fields of DESCRIPTION.

Version 0.1-2 (2011-03-12):

 - Updated contact information
 - The MAMSE weights for copulas did not convert the data into rescaled ranks.
   This is now performed through the function ranked that can be redefined to 
   allow different scaling of the ranks.

Version 0.1-3 (2013-06-27):

 - Addition of an explicit NAMESPACE to comply with the current requirements 
   for R packages.
 - Changes to the example of WKME to speed up the exeuction time in order
   to respect CRAN's policies.

Version 0.1-4 (2013-07-09):

 - Fixed a bug in MAMSE for univariate or multivariate data. In the infrequent
   case where the unconstrained optimization yields more than one negative
   weight, the wrong population could be removed. This bug did not affect the
   survival MAMSE weights.

Version 0.2-0 (2016-01-15):

 - Added functions for ROC curves and MAMSE weighted ROC curves.
 - Minor changes to NAMESPACE and to corresponding sections of the code.

Version 0.2-1 (2017-01-07):

 - Modification to the MAMSE weights for copulas: Monte Carlo integration as
   an alternative to compute the objective function for the weights.
